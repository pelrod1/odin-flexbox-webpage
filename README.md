# odin-flexbox-webpage
I have taken a lot of time awy from doing anything productive lately. I am going to do better and get moving with this coding chapter in my life. I really need to move on from customer service and get a better future for myself. It is never too late, and I am still young. now is the time to invest in myself to make the future awesome. 

this project is to make a good looking website. I haven't looked at it yet, but it will be using flex box to disign it.
